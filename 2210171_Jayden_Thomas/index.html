                  <h3>AI Business Idea Report</h3>
                  <p>Based on the "AI Businesses of 2026" article</p>
                  <article>
                    <p>In recent years people and organizations have been trying to identify ways in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to benefit them financially. However, the most common way people have been implementing AI  is through content creation, whether for creating articles or videos on platforms such as Youtube and Instagram, while neglecting to realize its use can be much more than that.  The article titled "AI Business of 2026"  highlights this fact, while simultaneously showing ways to identify its broader use and the emerging opportunities of implementing them. The article lists 20 alternative ways AI can be used for creating a business, with my favourite being using AI for “Automated Inventory Management”.
                    This idea piqued my interest because it was a topic that I covered in my foundations of information systems class last semester and my group members and I from that class even drafted an idea on how it can be implemented within grocery stores. The article identified many of the ways that we also found that AI can benefit an organization  in the real world such as: Managing demand-supply, through  understanding demand tracking stock levels and automatically reordering supplies without human intervention. Handling market fluctuations, through predicting seasonal demand fluctuations and offering insights into manufacturing, pricing or other profit minded changes. And improve transportation efficiency by suggesting efficient ways of delivery goods <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/ai-business-ideas/?utm_term=&utm_custom1=&utm_custom2=&utm_lptheme=&utm_lpmod=&utm_mt=b&gad_campaignid=20991268246" target="_blank">(M, 2024)</a>. This would speed up stocking of goods ensuring that it is always readily available, reduce human error when logging data and lessen the cost of human labour.<br><br>
                    Consequently integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into inventory management introduces significant ethical challenges, primarily centered on labor displacement, algorithmic bias, and the erosion of worker privacy. As AI systems increasingly automate high-volume, repetitive tasks such as demand forecasting and stock replenishment there is a growing risk of "bifurcation" in the workforce, where entry-level roles are eliminated in favor of a small number of high-paid technical positions <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2025/program/paper/BBsK4Zkd" target="_blank">(CRN, 2025, pg 4-7)</a>. Furthermore, if AI models are trained on historical data that reflects existing socioeconomic prejudices, they can automate "digital redlining," leading to unfair stock distribution or pricing across different geographic regions <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/research-metrics-and-analytics/articles/10.3389/frma.2024.1486600/full" target="_blank">(IJSRM, 2024)</a>. Beyond fairness, the use of AI for "algorithmic management" in warehouses can lead to a surveillance-heavy environment that prioritizes machine efficiency over human dignity and physical well-being 
                    <a href="https://unu.edu/article/invisible-colleague-balancing-algorithmic-management-workers-rights" target="_blank">(Vintly, 2026)</a>.<br><br>To mitigate these moral concerns, organizations must adopt a human-centric automation framework that prioritizes transparency and accountability. A viable solution involves implementing "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL) protocols, ensuring that sensitive decisions regarding supplier relations or labor quotas are vetted by human managers rather than automated blindly <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work" target="_blank">(McKinsey, 2025)</a>. Additionally, companies should commit to "upskilling" programs that transition displaced manual laborers into AI-oversight roles, thereby maintaining employment while increasing digital literacy <a href="https://rsmus.com/middle-market/workforce-mmbi.html" target="_blank">(RSM Global, 2026)</a>. 
                    An excellent example of this approach in practice is Netstock, which offers AI-driven inventory optimization tools designed with "Explainable AI" features. Netstock’s platform includes AI assistants that provide plain-language reasoning for its recommendations, allowing human planners to understand the "why" behind an automated order and intervene if the logic conflicts with ethical or social values.

      	<!-- Twelve Pillars Summary  -->
      <section id="development">
          <h2>Twelve Pillars Summary</h2>
          <article>
              <u><h3>Chapter 4: Achieve your goals (Pillar 4)</h3></u>
              <p>Summary: This chapter emphasizes that goals are the roadmap to a designed life. Charlie teaches Michael that the greatest value of a goal is not the prize at the end, but who you must become to achieve it. He encourages Michael to move beyond "drifting" and to start writing his goals down, as the act of writing transforms a vague wish into a concrete commitment. </br>
              <br>Personal Alignment:To align this with my life, I must move away from simply "hoping" for a better future and start documenting specific, measurable objectives. By focusing on the process of growth—such as the discipline and resilience built while working toward a promotion or a fitness milestone—I can appreciate that the personal transformation is more permanent and valuable than any trophy or paycheck.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
              <br><br>
              <u><h3>Chapter 5: Proper use of time (Pillar Five)</h3></u>
              <p>Summary: The focus here shifts to the distinction between being busy and being productive. Charlie explains that "every day has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity." He highlights the "pain of discipline" versus the "pain of regret," noting that discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons. Effective time management is about prioritizing the important over the urgent.</br>
              <br>Personal Alignment: I can apply this by performing a "time audit" on my daily routine to see how much energy I waste on urgent but low-value tasks (like reactive emails or social media). By choosing the "pain" of staying disciplined with a schedule now, I am actively protecting my future self from the "tons" of regret that come from wasted years.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
              <br><br>
              <u><h3>Chapter 6: Surround Yourself with the Best People (Pillar Six)</h3></u>
              <p>Summary: This chapter introduces the "Law of Association," which posits that we become the average of the people we spend the most time with. Charlie advises Michael to be selective with his inner circle, suggesting that one should "go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high." Relationships are categorized into disassociation, limited association, or expanded association.<br><br>
              Personal Alignment: Aligning with this pillar requires a courageous evaluation of my social circle. I need to seek out mentors and peers who challenge me to think bigger and act with more integrity. If I find myself in an "easy crowd" where no one pushes me to grow, I must consciously seek out environments—whether professional groups or volunteer organizations—where the standards are higher than my own.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
              <br><br>
              <u><h3>Chapter 7: Be a Life-Long Learner (Pillar Seven)</h3></u>
              <p>Summary: Rohn famously states in this chapter that "formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune." Charlie encourages Michael to become a student of life by reading books, attending seminars, and observing successful people. Learning is presented as the beginning of health, wealth, and spirituality.<br><br>
              Personal Alignment: To integrate this, I must view my graduation from formal schooling not as the end, but as the beginning of my education. Setting a goal to read one book a month or master a new skill every year ensures that I remain valuable and adaptable. This proactive approach to learning turns curiosity into a tool for financial and personal freedom.</p>
